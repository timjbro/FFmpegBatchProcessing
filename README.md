# FFmpeg Batch Processing

This repo contains a collection of Windows batch files, for processing / converting a folder full of video files using FFmpeg.

You will need to have FFmpeg on your PC and add it to your Windows PATH environment variable for these batch files to work.
Here is a tutorial video to help you get set-up with FFmpeg. https://youtu.be/zTrI8l26Zl8

These batch files have been tested with Windows 10 using FFmpeg version "ffmpeg-4.4.1-essentials_build".
